# @vaadin/sso-kit-client-core

The **SSO Kit Client Core** is a common library of the **[SSO Kit Client Lit](../lit)** and **[SSO Kit Client React](../react)** client side libraries.

This library is private, so it is not published into public registry. However, its sources are included into other two libraries during building, packaging and publishing.

## Development

For the available scripts check the [package.json](./package.json) file.
